## Avoid Deleting Root/Database and Project Safety Best Practices

- Implement database-level safeguards such as triggers to prevent accidental DELETE operations.
- Restrict user permissions in the database and filesystem to limit delete rights to only necessary users.
- Mark critical files and folders as immutable on Linux (`chattr +i`) or read-only on Windows (NTFS permissions).
- Use aliases or safety wrappers for destructive commands (`rm`, `del`) to require confirmation before deletion.
- In IDEs, prefer remove or exclude folder operations that do not physically delete files (e.g., IntelliJ content root removal).
- Regularly back up your database and project files with automated or manual systems.
- Use version control (Git) extensively to track, revert, and protect code changes.
- Separate critical database files or root folders into protected or less accessible locations.
- Educate your team about safe file and database handling practices.
- Automate checks for sensitive actions in CI/CD pipelines or pre-commit hooks.

# Solidity Smart Contract Clean Practices and Project Safety

## Solidity Code Implementation Techniques

- Use descriptive, intention-revealing names for variables, functions, and contracts.
- Avoid vague or misleading names to improve readability, auditability, and maintainability.
- Each function, contract, or library should have one clear, focused purpose (SRP).
- Express code intent clearly to minimize comments; document "why" decisions when necessary.
- Replace magic numbers and strings with named `constant` or `immutable` variables.
- Organize project using modules and interfaces; split logic into reusable components with imports.
- Favor code simplicity and clarity; avoid overly clever code constructs or gas-cost tradeoffs that risk security.
- Implement centralized and consistent error handling using `require`, `assert`, and custom error types.
- Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern for state changes involving external calls to avoid reentrancy.
- Avoid arithmetic overflow/underflow; use built-in checked math or SafeMath for older Solidity versions.
- Use access control modifiers (`onlyOwner`, role-based access) and OpenZeppelin libraries for sensitive actions.
- Write and maintain robust unit/integration tests before deploying contracts; use TDD methodology.
- Implement differential and fuzz testing using tools like Echidna, Foundry for property-based testing.
- Conduct testnet simulation with mainnet forking to replicate real-world interactions and catch edge cases.
- Perform gas and economic analysis; record and optimize for realistic gas limits with documented benchmarks.
- Prevent duplications by abstracting repeated logic into reusable libraries and utility contracts.
- Employ static analysis tools like Slither, MythX for vulnerability checks; resolve all high/critical issues before mainnet deployment.
- Regularly refactor code for simplicity and reduced technical debt.
- Do not use emoji, non-standard Unicode, or confusing ASCII art in contract code or comments.
- Use Solidity latest stable version unless required otherwise for compatibility.

## Avoiding Destructive Operations and Project Safety

- Restrict permissions for deployment, upgrade, and critical contract interactions; whitelist trusted addresses only.
- Use robust ownership and admin-control frameworks (Multi-sig, Timelock, etc.) for upgradeable contracts.
- Implement automated role management with on-chain governance (DAO patterns) for permission escalation/delegation.
- Integrate updatable allowlist mechanisms managed by contract owners or on-chain voting for access control.
- Do not implement code capable of self-destructing essential contracts (`selfdestruct`) or erasing core data.
- Log and audit all sensitive administrative operations; events for changes and access attempts.
- Enable contract pausing and emergency stop mechanisms (e.g., `Pausable`) for incident response.
- Back up source code and deployment scripts using version control (Git) and off-chain secure storage.
- Do not deploy raw test or development contracts to mainnet; use safe release and auditing processes.
- Implement automated CI pipelines for build, test, and security validation steps; validate critical actions in pre-commit/checks.
- Use comprehensive audit trails for future project reviews.

## Disaster Recovery and Incident Response

- Create clear disaster recovery playbooks for key compromise scenarios (emergency upgrade/disable, rotating roles).
- Document process for contract shutdown and post-mortem disclosure procedures tailored to on-chain context.
- Implement secure upgrade paths with transparent process for implementation swaps and pausing during upgrades.
- Require user/community approval before redeployment of critical contracts.
- Establish clear communication protocols for security incidents and emergency responses.
- Maintain emergency contact lists and escalation procedures for different severity levels.

## General Project Safety, Collaboration & Management

- Define clear roles, responsibilities, and access controls for all contributors, reviewers, and owners.
- Maintain high-quality documentation for contracts, ABI, deployment steps, and governance processes.
- Communicate security incidents, risk factors, and fixes effectively with the whole team.
- Foster regular code reviews, multi-party audits, and leverage community feedback where appropriate.
- Track high-impact bugs, confirmed vulnerabilities, upgrades, and rationale for all major changes.
- Use effective collaboration and communication platforms (Slack, Discord, etc.) to streamline development and incident response.
- Practice continuous improvement: conduct post-mortem/root-cause analysis after incidents and deployments.

## Bug Bounty and Community Engagement

- Implement standing public bug bounty programs (e.g., Immunefi) for incentivizing white-hat security reviews.
- Establish clear bug bounty scope, reward tiers, and disclosure timelines.
- Create channels for community security researchers to report vulnerabilities responsibly.
- Maintain public security contact information and clear reporting procedures.
- Recognize and reward community contributions to project security.

## Dependency Management and Supply Chain Security

- Snapshot and review all external contract/library dependencies in the build pipeline.
- Prevent supply chain attacks by freezing dependency versions and auditing updates.
- Maintain a dependency inventory with security status and update schedules.
- Use dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in external libraries.
- Document rationale for each external dependency and its security implications.

## Legal and Compliance Requirements

- Mandate SPDX license identifiers for all source files to avoid open source licensing ambiguity.
- Ensure compliance with relevant financial regulations and data protection laws.
- Document data handling practices and user privacy protections.
- Maintain clear terms of service and user agreements for contract interactions.
- Keep audit trails for regulatory compliance and legal requirements.

## Real-Time Monitoring and Operational Excellence

- Implement real-time monitoring tools (Tenderly, Forta, OpenZeppelin Defender) for detecting live contract anomalies.
- Set up automated alerting for attack patterns and suspicious contract interactions.
- Monitor gas usage patterns and transaction success rates for operational insights.
- Track contract state changes and access patterns for security analysis.
- Implement health checks and automated monitoring for critical contract functions.

## Upgradeability and Transparency Requirements

- If using upgradable proxies, require clear user disclaimers and UI warnings about upgradeability.
- Publish proxy admin addresses and upgrade mechanisms transparently to users.
- Implement minimum announcement periods for critical upgrades with public discussion periods.
- Require community feedback incorporation for major contract decisions.
- Regularly verify immutable variables are never accidentally exposed to reinitialization.

## Summary of Auditing and Deployment Best Practices

- Prepare full documentation before each audit (contract code, architecture, goals).
- Run both automated and manual security tests; prioritize fixing critical and major issues.
- Publish comprehensive, transparent audit reports and changelogs after final deployment.
- Do not deploy contracts until all high-severity risks are addressed and tested on testnets.

## Solidity Naming Instructions

- Name every smart contract using PascalCase (e.g., TokenSale, VotingContract, RewardDistributor).
- Use descriptive names that convey the main functionality or responsibility of the contract—avoid vague or generic names like Contract1.
- The filename should match the main contract's name for clarity and discoverability (e.g., TokenSale.sol contains contract TokenSale).
- When including multiple contracts in a single file (not recommended), ensure the filename matches the core contract's name.
- Avoid abbreviations or single-letter names unless widely-accepted (such as ERC20).
- For test contracts, append Test to the contract being tested (e.g., ERC20Test).
- Library and struct names should also use PascalCase and be descriptive.

## Security Best Practices

- Use Latest Compiler Version: Always compile with the latest stable Solidity version to benefit from security patches and improved checks.
- Avoid Reentrancy Vulnerabilities: Apply the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. Use ReentrancyGuard from OpenZeppelin or manual mutexes to prevent reentrant calls.
- Restrict Access with Proper Modifiers: Use onlyOwner, onlyRole, or custom access controls to protect sensitive functions.
- Validate All Inputs: Use strict validation (require statements) for function parameters to prevent invalid data and unsafe states.
- Use Safe Math: For Solidity versions below 0.8, use SafeMath libraries for overflow/underflow protection; from 0.8+ native checked arithmetic is available.
- Minimize Contract Complexity: Keep contracts simple and focused to reduce attack surface and ease auditing.
- Implement Circuit Breakers: Use Pausable contracts that allow halting contract functions during emergency situations.
- Avoid Delegatecall with Untrusted Contracts: Delegatecall can lead to code execution in the caller context—only use with trusted contracts.
- Use Proper Randomness: Do not rely on block variables (block.timestamp, blockhash) for randomness. Use verified oracles or VRF services.
- Store Private Data Off-Chain: Do not store secrets or private keys on-chain as blockchain data is public.
- Limit Gas Consumption: Avoid unbounded loops or large state modifications that might run out of gas and cause failures.
- Write Comprehensive Tests: Cover edge cases and perform fuzz testing to catch unexpected scenarios.
- Static and Dynamic Analysis: Use tools like Slither, MythX, and Echidna to detect vulnerabilities before deployment.
- Audit and Review: Conduct manual audits with security experts and peer code reviews regularly.
- Use Upgradable Patterns Carefully: If using proxy contracts, ensure upgrade mechanisms have strict administrative control and transparent upgrade processes.
- Log All Critical Actions: Emit events for key state changes to maintain an audit trail.
- Avoid Using Deprecated Features: Do not use deprecated Solidity features or unsafe inline assembly.
- Implement Time Locks and Multisig: For admin operations, require time delay and multiple signatures to execute important transactions.
